# Unofficial-Calamity-Addon-Mod-Marnite-Deconstructor-Upgrades

An unofficial addon for the Calamity Mod for Terraria.

---

## About

Have you ever played the Calamity Mod while only using tools?
Well I have - and sadly, the mod was not designed with that in mind.

This addon was created to smooth out progression for tool-only runs by
adding two new weapons that extend the upgrade line of the Marnite Deconstructor.

The goal is not to rebalance Calamity, but to make a niche challenge
run feel more complete and enjoyable.

## Features

- Two new tool-based weapons
- Extended upgrade progression
- Balanced around Calamity progression
- Designed specifically for tool-only playthroughs

---

## Requirements

- Terraria
- tModLoader
- Calamity Mod (required dependency)

This mod will not function without Calamity installed.

=> Please check it out on the Steam Workshop: *Coming Soon*
