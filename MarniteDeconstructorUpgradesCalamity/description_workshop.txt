[h1]Tool-Only Calamity Addon[/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[b]Have you ever played the Calamity Mod while only using tools?[/b]

Well I have — and sadly, the mod was not designed with that in mind.

This addon was created to smooth out progression for tool-only runs by adding [b]two new weapons[/b] that extend the upgrade line of the [b]Marnite Deconstructor[/b].

[h2]Purpose[/h2]

The goal is [b]not[/b] to rebalance Calamity.

Instead, this mod exists to make a niche challenge run feel more complete, more natural, and more enjoyable without disrupting normal progression.
