Have you ever played the Calamity Mod while only using tools? Well I have - and sadly, the mod was not designed with that in mind.

This addon was created to smooth out progression for tool-only runs by adding two new weapons that extend the upgrade line of the Marnite Deconstructor.

The goal is not to rebalance Calamity, but to make a niche challenge run feel more complete and enjoyable.
